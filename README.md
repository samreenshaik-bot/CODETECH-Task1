## Overview of the Project

## Project: Creating a Simple Calculator by using python language

##Project Description
This project involves creating a simple calculator using Python. The calculator will perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The goal is to create an intuitive command-line application that accepts user inputs and returns the correct results.

Key Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Input Validation:

Ensures that the user inputs valid numbers.
Checks for division by zero errors and other potential exceptions.
Continuous Operation:

The calculator will continue to prompt the user for input until they decide to exit.
Error Handling:

Catches common errors (e.g., invalid inputs, division by zero) and provides user-friendly error messages.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x: The primary programming language used to develop the calculator.
Standard Python Libraries: Includes basic libraries like math (optional, for more advanced functions).
Code Structure
Main Function: The entry point of the program that calls other functions.
Helper Functions: Functions for each operation (addition, subtraction, etc.) and for input validation.
Project Files
calculator.py: The main Python file containing all the code for the calculator.
